        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size: 2em">
            I am a developer from Ohio who's been programming for almost a decade.
            My gateway into coding started by learning how to use Minecraft's (then) esoteric command block language.
            <br><br>
            With these skills, I developed features for a Vanilla (no plugins) server not seen on any other, and helped in making it the most popular of its kind.
            From there, I excelled with Java and Swift over two years at my local high school.
            <br><br>
            During this time, I partipated in four hackathons, placing 1st in two local competitions and top 10 in the Kent State and Ohio State University competitions.
            I also participated in a nation-wide game development team competition with the Business Professionals of America, where we placed 8th overall.
            <br><br>
            I am currently at the University of Toledo majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.
            One of my key interests is game development, but since my college does not offer courses for this, I am working on projects independently.
            My senior classes will be focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
