        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size: 2em">
            MC_2018 is a developer from Ohio who's been programming for almost a decade.
            His gateway into coding started by learning how to use Minecraft's (then) esoteric command block language.
            <br><br>
            With these skills, he developed features for a Vanilla server (a server with no external plugins) not seen elsewhere, and helped in making it the most popular of its kind.
            From there, he excelled with Java and Swift during his last two years of high school.
            <br><br>
            During this time, MC partipated in four hackathons, placing 1st in two local competitions and top 10 in the Kent State and Ohio State University competitions.
            He also led a team for a nation-wide game development competition with the Business Professionals of America, where they placed 8th overall.
            <br><br>
            As of now, MC is attending the University of Toledo, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.
            One of his key interests is game development, but since his college does not offer courses for this, he is working on learning this skill independently.
            His senior classes will be spent focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
