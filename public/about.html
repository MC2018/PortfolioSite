                MC_2018 is a developer who's been programming for almost a decade.
                His gateway into coding started by learning how to use Minecraft's (then) esoteric command block language.
                He developed features for a Vanilla server (a server with no external plugins) not seen elsewhere, making it the most popular of its time.
                <br><br>
                From there, MC excelled with Java and Swift during his last two years of high school.
                During that time, he partipated in four hackathons where he placed 1st in two local competitions and top 10 in the Kent State and Ohio State University competitions.
                He also led a team for a nation-wide game development competition with the
                <a href="https://bpa.org/">Business Professionals of America</a>, where they placed 8th overall.
                <br><br>
                As of now, MC is a senior at the University of Toledo, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.
                One of his key interests is game development, but since his college does not offer courses for this, he is learning this skill independently.
                His senior classes will be spent focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
