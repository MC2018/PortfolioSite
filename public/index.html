                    MC_2018 is a developer who's been programming for almost a decade.
                    His gateway into coding started with Minecraft's esoteric command block language.
                    With these skills, he developed unique features for a popular Vanilla server (a server with no external plugins).
                    <br><br>
                    From there, MC excelled with Java and Swift during his last two years of high school.
                    During that time, he partipated in many hackathons, either winning or placing among the top.
                    He also led a team for a nation-wide game development competition with the
                    <a href="https://bpa.org/">Business Professionals of America</a>, where they placed 8th overall.
                    <br><br>
                    As of now, MC is a senior at the University of Toledo, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering and minoring in Mathematics.
                    One of his key interests is game development, and his senior classes will be spent focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

                            <br><br>
                            The project started in June of 2020 and is in active development with associates of mine.
                            My role as CTO has me working on most game mechanics and leading how the codebase should be structured.
                            This project is very much a work-in-progress.

                            In October of 2017, my friends and I entered a nation-wide 2D platformer game development challenge hosted by the
                            <a href="https://bpa.org/">Business Professionals of America</a>.
                            I led the team and handled development of the game's physics engine, display, and input.
                            <br><br>
                            In May of 2018, we travelled to Dallas for their national event where we showcased our game to a wide
                            range of panelists, and placed 8th overall.
                            While we could have put much more work into the game, I am proud of having developed a game engine for this project
                            instead of choosing a pre-existing engine.

                            A recreation of Tetris seemed a bit lackluster for a 12-hour hackathon with a party of four,
                            so instead in December of 2017, we developed a unique two-player versus-style version.
                            <br><br>
                            One player controlled the Tetris game, while the other controlled a physics-bound character, trying to
                            dodge the tetronimos as they fell down. For this project, I worked on the input controls and physics engine of the game,
                            and we ended up winning the competition with it.

                            In 2014, a friend and I created our own Minecraft server; however, I wanted to make it "Vanilla".
                            This means making a server with the original (unoptimized) JAR provided by the developers with no external plugins enabled.
                            My challenge was to get a server as functioning as any other plugin-based server through the use of in-game commands and command blocks.
                            <br><br>
                            We accomplished all of this and more; I developed systems to set multiple homes, allow player teleport requests,
                            enable spawn protection, moderate rule breakers, and much more.
                            With these features in place, it became the most popular Vanilla server in the world.
                            <br><br>
                            A large challenge with this project was optimization.
                            Command blocks can be fairly lag-inducive; this paired with Mojang's poor multiplayer optimizations made better program designing a must.

                            For a local hackathon in Fall of 2017, I wanted to hide text inside of any image you gave it with password protection.
                            Two friends of mine helped in development of this 24-hour challenge where we magnified the image size and stored bits of data from slight offsets in its RGB values.
                            <br><br>
                            We won the competition but we weren't proud of the outcome; a year later, we improved upon the original design and placed Top 10 at the 2018 HackOHI/O OSU hackathon.
                            I was still unhappy with how slow the finished version was; the GitHub repo shows a complete redesign by me, focusing on optimizations, securities, and long-term scalability.

                            A predecessor to Plain Sight, I grew intrigued with encryption in July of 2017.
                            This simpler idea would hide a message, locked with a password, in an image filled with noise.
                            <br><br>
                            One thing to improve upon for this project would be to randomize which pixels held your data;
                            as-is, it saves the encrypted data like one would a book; all pixels after an extent are random nonsense.
                            Spreading out the data based on the password would be a more secure approach moving forward.

                        I started this project in Fall of 2020 to strengthen my resume.
                        Additionally, I wanted better to get a better grasp of CSS's potential (since I would often use too much JavaScript for effects).
                        <br><br>
                        Along with achieving that, I also learned how to support mobile devices using different layouts.
                        The backend utilizes Express for requests, Winston for logging, and Nodemailer for my contact area to forward emails.

                            A pet peeve of mine has been the poor quality of music shuffler algorithms;
                            Spotify replays songs too often for my taste and YouTube doesn't properly shuffle playlists over 100 videos.
                            This is the problem that I aspired to solve in May of 2017.
                            Using a GUI, this program allows you to manage replayability of individual playlists locally.
                            <br><br>
                            Over the years, I have re-designed this program, and currently have plans to create a server-based version.
                            This will allow for accounts to sync playlist data between multiple devices.

                            I started my creation of Discord bots in 2017 when I developed two different bots: one for a friend, and one for a YouTuber.
                            These bots shared gambling commands, but had custom commands for each demographic (involving Pokemon, Clash Royale, and CS:GO).
                            <br><br>
                            As time progressed, and more bots were made, I started making the program simplified and expandable.
                            This ended up being a more straightforward abstraction of the JDA library
                            (which has helped my friend in developing <a href="https://github.com/Hyreon/Frostbalance">his own Discord project</a>).
                            <br><br>
                            My most popular bot is made to fetch speedrun data from
                            <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">Speedrun.com</a> for both leaderboards and individual runs;
                            their API, however, isn't always optimal, so I additionally used Selenium and JSoup to scrape info from their site's HTML.
                            My latest bot is a group project manager which I initially created for my own use in my ongoing projects.
                            It manages task organization (similar to JIRA) for the Discord platform and provides GitHub PR notifications.

                            Puzzle games have always been interesting for me, so I wanted to learn how to generate sudoku puzzles.
                            After jokingly trying to randomly brute-force sudoku points (to no avail), I created a wholly unique algorithm in 2018.
                            <br><br>
                            Along with normal sudokus, I also created an option to force-enable maps with diagonal matches.
                            I was able to get the normal generation time down to ~10ms per map, and around 1-2 seconds per diagonal map.
