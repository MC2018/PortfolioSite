                        Faithfall (a working title) is a 2D platformer using the Unity engine.
                        The project started in June of 2020 and is in active development with associates of mine.
                        My role as CTO has me working on most game mechanics and leading how the codebase should be structured.
                        This project is very much a work-in-progress, so there is nothing yet to show regarding it.

                        <a href="https://bpa.org/">Business Professionals of America</a>.
                        I led the team and handled development of the game's physics engine, display, and input.

                        In May of 2018, we travelled to Dallas for their national event where we showcased our game to a wide
                        range of panelists, and placed 8th overall.
                        While we could have done much more work into the game, I am proud of having developed a game engine for this project
                        instead of choosing a pre-existing engine.

                        so instead in December of 2017, we developed a unique two-player versus-style version.
                        One player controlled the Tetris game, while the other controlled a physics-bound character, trying to

                    <p>
                        In 2014, a friend and I created our own Minecraft server; however, unlike the vast majority of people, I wanted to make it "Vanilla".
                        This is a server with the original JAR provided by the developers, Mojang, with no external plugins enabled.
                        My challenge was to get a server as functioning as any other plugin-based server through the use of in-game commands and command blocks.
                        <br><br>
                        We were able to accomplish all of this and more; I developed systems to set multiple homes, teleport request to other players,
                        enable spawn protections with safe zones, moderate rule breakers, and much more.
                        Because of all these features, we became the most popular Vanilla server in the world for months, and remain one of the more notable Vanilla servers to this day.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the largest challenges for this was ensuring the command blocks were optimized.
                        Some features that normally wouldn't be a challenge when writing Java-based plugins can become very lag-inducive.
                        This becomes more apparent due to the Mojang-provided JAR's poor multiplayer optimizations in general.

                    <p>
                        I started my creation of Discord bots in 2017 when I developed two different bots: one for a friend, and one for a YouTuber.
                        These bots shared gambling commands, but had custom commands for each demographic (involving Pokemon, Clash Royale, and CS:GO).
                        <br><br>
                        As time progressed, and more bots were made, I started making the program simplified and expandable.
                        This ended up being a more straightforward abstraction of the JDA library
                        (which has helped my friend in developing <a href="https://github.com/Hyreon/Frostbalance">his own Discord project</a>).
                        <br><br>
                        My most popular bot is made to fetch speedrun data from
                        <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">Speedrun.com</a> for both leaderboards and individual runs;
                        their API, however, isn't always optimal, so I additionally used Selenium and JSoup to scrape info from their site's HTML.
                        My latest bot is a group project manager which I initially created for my own use in my ongoing Faithfall project.
                        It manages task organization (similar to JIRA) for the Discord platform and provides GitHub PR notifications.

                        For a local hackathon in Fall of 2017, I wanted to figure out how to hide text inside of any image you gave it with password protection.
                        Two friends of mine helped in development of this 24-hour challenge where we magnified the image size and stored bits of data from slight offsets in its RGB values.
                        <br><br>
                        We won the competition but we weren't proud of the outcome; a year later, we improved upon the original design and placed Top 10 at the 2018 HackOHI/O OSU hackathon.
                        I was still unhappy with how slow the finished version was; the GitHub repo shows a complete redesign by me, focusing on optimizations, securities, and long-term scalability.

                        A predecessor to the above project, my intrigue with encryption in July of 2017 started with this concept.
                        This simpler idea would, provided a password and text, create an image filled with noise (example shown).
                        While this type of obfuscation may be more obvious than more, it does the job for simpler things.
                        <br><br>
                        One thing to improve upon for this project would be to randomize which pixels held your data;
                        as it currently stands, it saves the encrypted data like one would a book, all pixels after an extent are random nonsense.
                        Spreading out the data based on the password would be a much wiser decision moving forward.

                        Additionally, I wanted to obtain a better grasp of how much I can truly utilize CSS for aesthetics and features instead of JavaScript.
                        Along with achieving that, I also learned how to support mobile devices using different layouts.
                        The backend utilizes Express for requests, Winston for logging, and Nodemailer for my contact page to forward emails to myself.

                        A pet peeve of mine has been the poor quality of music shufflers;
                        Spotify playlists replays songs too quickly and YouTube playlists don't properly shuffle playlists over 100 videos.
                        This is the problem that I aspired to solve in May of 2017.
                        Using a GUI, this program allows you to manage replayability of individual playlists locally.
                        <br><br>
                        Over the years, I have re-designed this program, and currently have plans to create a server-based version.

                        Puzzle games have always been interesting for me, so I wanted to learn how to generate sudoku puzzles.
                        After jokingly trying to randomly brute-force sudoku points (to no avail), I created a wholly unique algorithm in 2018.
                        Along with normal sudokus, I also created an option to force-enable maps with diagonal matches.
                        I was able to get the normal generation time down to ~10ms per map, and around 1-2 seconds per diagonal map.
